As we progressed, the walls were covered in neon colors and psychedelic patterns. It is also important to note that at the beginning of this section, there were two girls in red, white, and black outfits dancing on an elevated platform. Anyways, after the first walkway, we entered a tunnel that was blacked out and spinning with neon dots scattered throughout it. After this, there was one more walkway until it was over and I remember it being narrow. It was similar to the first walkway where the walls were bright and psychedelic. Right before we left, on the left near the entrance of the spinning tunnel that was next to where we exit, there was a large neon green pipe coming from the ground. I remember this being kinda disorienting but not very scary. Once we left, we walked past those dancing girls again and handed our glasses back to the guy working.

The entire vibe and this Asylum was my favorite of the entire experience strictly because it matched the vibe of the eastern state penitentiary so well. ,1,67.11,67.92,15.38,13.81,1.19,1.19,0,0,11.31,0,11.31,1.79,2.98,0.6,2.38,2.98,1.19,1.19,5.36,1.79,2.38,3.57,0.6,2.38,2.38,0,0,0.6,10.71,1.79,0,0,0,0.6,0.6,8.93,0,0,5.36,2.38,0,0.6,1.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.36,13.1,0,2.38,8.33,2.38,0,0,1.79,5.36,-14.45,-31.66,4.71,-16.4,3,2,1,1,3,2,0,40,100,45.45,24.85,50,100,0,59.09,7.58,100,0,100,3.03,3.03,3,0,0,6,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,10,4,14,0.714285714,9,0.666666667,168,23

And houses in the past have always scared me most with a chainsaw. I knew that was going to be the scariest moment for me especially when he started to reach 4 feet with the chainsaw. I also remember there being a lot of banging of metal and loud noises. Walking through a couple rooms there was a man with a hammer banging it on a metal table and screaming at us as he was doing so. This was the most disturbing because I couldn’t hear myself think as he was doing so. The hostess letting us in before we went in was also very scary and intriguing. The first thing I remember was her eyes and how great of a character she was playing as a scary guard. As soon as we walked in there were these cell looking rooms where people would lunge out behind the bars and try to grab us. This was by far one of the scariest starts to the the house that we entered.

I thought that at any moment, one of them was going to startle us, I even kept turning around to make sure they hadn’t moved. As we exited the bus, there was a loud rattling noise. I didn’t see the man that did it, but as I walked past I saw him. I think he was old and bearded and was making the noise by dragging something rapidly across a laminated sheet. I yelled “What are you doing?!” In surprise and he responded with something like “Scaring you!”. After that, I remember a long passageway intercepted by cages and others, curtained passages. There were people with cloaks and demonlike masks. Being at the end of the line, the demons were walking behind me, and one of them decided to follow me ominously through the entirety of the tour.

I think it started with a bus that had some fake people  dummies  and some actors trying to blend in to get a jump scare on us. it didnt really scare me because i saw them move beforehand and could predict what was going to happen. from then we left the bus and went into a building. in the building we walked through a bunch of rooms with actors in them all doing different things. i think there was a doctors office and a bunch of cages in this part of the haunted house. it was super cold that day so we walked fast through the house. we went up some stairs and there was a long hallway with moveable floorboards which was kinda cool. we walked thru the caged hallway and then the thing ended,1,66.76,50.83,86.1,5.4,4.22,3.61,0.6,0,9.64,0.6,9.04,1.2,0.6,1.2,0.6,0.6,4.22,0,5.42,1.81,3.61,1.81,0,1.81,1.81,0,0,0,6.63,0.6,0,0,0,0.6,0,6.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.01,15.06,0,5.42,7.83,0.6,0,1.2,0.6,3.01,-15.53,14.65,-7.52,-53.71,3,4,1,4,3,2,29.41,16.67,100,0,33.33,76.96,83.33,0,100,50,100,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,7,4,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,21,2,23,0.913043478,17,0.411764706,166,18

After walking through there I remember walking through a room where people kept running past us on either side.  Then, I remember being handed 3D glasses and going through a section that again was filled with very bright neon colors with pictures and objects that popped off the walls even more.  There was a large spider on the wall somewhere in that section.  At the end we walked through a tube that was spinning on a platform that was slanted making it very difficult to walk.

After exiting that room we walked immediately to the left and walked around a woman in a red dress singing (high pitched, like an opera).  After there was a cut out section of the wall she was able to walk in and out of the room.

Then when we walked into the first room it was gray and there was a man standing behind a desk at the other corner of the room.  It was almost like a monochromatic scene, there was an announcement being played on a loudspeaker that he was mouthing (but not saying himself).  There was also a typewriter on the desk in front of him and he was smacking some metal object to jump scare people.  After leaving that room and entering the other there was a woman in a red dress singing opera music and she was going back and forth between that room and another.  We had to walk around her cage in the center.  I do not recall anything off the top of my head after this.

After we stepped outside and there was a woman who ran up besides us with a chainsaw, but just before we stepped outside I could smell gas to the left (still inside), so I figured something like that was going to happen.

I remember first walking in and a character swinging a sledge hammer at my girlfriend who was in front of me.  I remembered this most because I was genuinely concerned something was going to happen and I was going to be stepping in.  It was also a shock because I dont remember anything the character looked like outside of a black figure and the sledgehammer.  Afterwards we continued through and I could smell gasoline/exhaust fumes of what I believed to be a chainsaw (I got this from my background with this).  Immediately after smelling this we stepped outside and a shorter woman bent over came running up the ramp towards the inside revving a chainsaw.  Afterwards we continued on back inside of another building and I remember walking around and through some box where a guy scared us in then came right back around and scared us coming out.  I remember this cause again, it was a jump scare right in my girlfriends face so I thought I was going to get defensive and then the character started laughing saying ""I got you didnt I"" and she responded ""yeah you did"" and he kept repeating this and them going back and forth saying he really got her and she said yes you did.  Then there was also a table saw somewhere in this section where someones hand had been chopped off.  I remember it being the darkest overall of the exhibits in terms of lighting throughout, if there was any light at all it was a pale white LED rather than bright lights like Infirmary, golden lights like in Asylum, and a mixture of both golden lights with just more colorful content (i.e. gory bloodsoaked or items, people, etc.) throughout the Ghostly Grounds.",1,48,42.01,94.94,10.41,2.98,2.32,0,0.66,10.93,0.66,10.26,2.98,1.66,0.33,2.32,0.66,1.66,1.99,3.31,0.99,1.99,1.99,0.33,1.32,1.32,0,0,0,8.28,1.66,0,0,0,0,1.66,6.62,0,0.66,1.99,0.99,0,0,1.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.64,18.87,0,3.31,10.6,4.97,0,0.33,1.66,4.64,0.81,33.89,-1.66,-29.8,2,4,1,4,5,2,49.79,100,57.43,0,70.19,61.62,12.44,45.45,100,0,100,0,51.11,17.22,0.28,16,0,0,15,3,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,3,34,8,42,0.80952381,31,0.483870968,303,23

I think with the Ghostly Grounds the memories I have are as follows:  there was a room that we entered that was bright and gory, had bodies hung upside down that were moving.  I also remember going up and down floors in the Ghostly Grounds which was unique compared to the other sections.  One section we went through was a cell block and I remember a box flashing with bright lights and banging around as if something was in it, all inside a cage to the right of the tour, as well as an air blast cannon that hit around my right calf.

I couldnt see very well and I was afraid of the actors being too close and that I would accidentally touch them, I tried to hold my arms behind me just in case so I wouldnt fold them in front of me and mess with the heart monitor. I remember going up and down stairs and through a section with swinging bodies and actors walking through. I was trying not to react too much so the actors would not target me more but I screamed at one and he followed me through growling in my ear that was the only time I audibly screamed/laughed in any section.

People in line seemed a little more nervous which probably made me anticipate more scares. Two young girls who went in in front of us ran out to take their glow necklaces off indicating they didn’t want any extra scares. There was as a scare actor at the entrance that was separating groups but knew we were part of the study and mentioned something to us about it. I then remember lots of chain saw sounds and body parts. I don’t remember many of the specific rooms but I could hear people in front of me screaming so I felt like I was anticipating a lot. ,1,57.55,26.6,98.76,1.27,3.31,3.31,0,0,16.53,0,16.53,4.96,0.83,1.65,3.31,0,5.79,2.48,3.31,0,3.31,3.31,0,3.31,3.31,0,0,0,9.09,0.83,0,0,0,0,0.83,8.26,0,0,0.83,0,0,0.83,0.83,0,0.83,0,0,0,0,4.13,19.83,0.83,2.48,10.74,2.48,2.48,0.83,2.49,4.13,-4.77,21.94,-0.53,-35.71,2,3,4,3,2,2,40,100,0,50,50,61.33,0,100,83.33,66.67,96,0,66.67,100,100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22

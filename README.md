# CABLAB R Workshop Series
11/27/2023  

__**Instructor:**__ Steven Martinez

## Description
This workshop will introduce basic R coding skills for an audience that has **little to no experience in R**. 

We will cover a breadth of topics including data cleaning, data visualizations, and carrying out statistical analyses. While a background in statistical theory is *helpful*, the module was designed such that it should not be *necessary* to follow along.

## To-do before the tutorial
1. Download R (version will depend on whether you have Mac or Windows)
         https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/
2. Download RStudio (which allows us to navigate R, but is a different program than R)  
         https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
3. Open up a new R Markdown document by clicking File > New File > R Markdown. **First time R users will be asked to download packages once they open up an R Markdown file. Click “Yes” to downloading those packages!**

## Workshop objectives:
- Learn how to navigate the RStudio environment
- Get familiar with R markdown (and more generally notebook style coding)
- Learn how to clean data
- Learn how to complete statistical analyses
- Learn how to visualize data

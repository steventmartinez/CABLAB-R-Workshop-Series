# CABLAB R Workshop Series
11/27/2023  

__**Instructor:**__ Steven Martinez
__**Content Creator:**__ Steven Martinez

## Description
This workshop will review basic R coding skills for an audience that has ***little to no experience in R***. 

We will cover a breadth of topics including data cleaning, data visualizations, and carrying out statistical analyses. While a background in statistical theory is *helpful*, the module was designed such that it should not be *necessary* to follow along.

## To-do before the tutorial
1. Download R (version will depend on whether you have Mac or Windows)
         https://cran.r-project.org/
2. Download RStudio (which allows us to navigate R, but is a different program from R)  
         https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

## Workshop objectives:
- Learn R syntax relating to dataframes
- Get familiar with RStudio and R markdown (and more generally notebook style coding)
- Learn how to work with data
- Learn how to complete statistical analyses
- Learn how to visualize data
